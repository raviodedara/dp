WELCOME TO CSV_Dashboard_Generator!

This tool allows you to instantly visualize any CSV file without writing code.
I have included a 'Sales Records.csv' file for you to test right away.

--- 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE ---

1. INSTALL REQUIREMENTS
   You need Python installed on your computer.
   Open your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. RUN THE APP
   Navigate to this folder and run:
   
   streamlit run dashboard.py
	
	or
   streamlit run (Copy as path from downloads and paste here)
    

3. HOW TO USE
   - A browser window will open automatically.
   - Drag and drop 'Sales Records.csv' (or your own file).
   - Use the SIDEBAR on the left to filter data.
   - Use the "Custom Chart Builder" to make your own graphs.

--- 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING ---
- If the browser doesn't open, look for a "Local URL" in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) and paste it into Chrome.
- Ensure your CSV file has headers (names for each column) in the first row.

Enjoy your automated dashboarding!
